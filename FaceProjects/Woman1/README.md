There has been an issue with overlapping face due to applied mirror modifier (Great mistake) so, I will have to carve (Or maybe I can merge vertices.) the Face all over again. Render1 image file shows the faulty carving due to modifier.

Update (06.05.2023): I carved the face all over again, fixed bump normals and painted lips. (render2)

Update (07.05.2023): I did some fixing to hair and eyes. (render3)

Update (11.05.2023): Body is rigged and all finished including poles. But because of some irreversible mistakes at the beginning of the project, I was unable to do automatic weight calculation. (Applying Subdivision surface is a great mistake. I learned that if model is very detailed, it can cause the blender to crash while any editing.)

Update (12.05.2023): I learned clothing and applied it as a crop top and pants. I recolored the hair. All I can do for this model is done.
